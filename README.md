# Decentralized-Bank-Model-with-Mock-Tether
Using Solidity, Truffle and Ganache to develop this decentral bank model.

There is mock Tether deployed in the ganache blcoks. 
And then the Webpage is the way you deposit the Mock Tether to the decentral Bank.(With MetaMask Accouunt)
With users who deposit over 50, its able to get reward coin as reward.
However, the function sending the reward coins is not completed yet Haha. And that's the project.
